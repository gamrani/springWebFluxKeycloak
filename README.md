# Spring Security 5 Workshop

## Initial application

This is the initial absolutely unsecured reactive web application.

This application deals with books and users.

A standard user can borrow or return borrowed books, a curator user can add or remove books
and an admin user can show, add or remove users.

Please start into the workshop with this initial application.
